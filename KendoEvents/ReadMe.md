# Calendar view for Events widget using Kendo Scheduler

This sample has been removed since the functionality it provides, is now part of Sitefinity. In order to display Sitefinity events inside [Kendo Scheduler](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/controls/scheduling/scheduler/overview) just drag the MVC Calendar widget on your page.
For additional information check the official [Sitefinity documentation](https://www.progress.com/documentation/sitefinity-cms/calendar-widget-mvc).
